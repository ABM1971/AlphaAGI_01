  "title": "Reimagining Coherent Backscattering as a Symmetry-Constrained Stochastic Process in Non-Abelian Group Space",
  "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel theoretical framework reinterpreting Coherent Backscattering (CBS) in disordered optical media as a symmetry-constrained stochastic return process within non-abelian group spaces, specifically SO(3) and SU(2). Moving beyond traditional understandings, we employ group theory and stochastic processes to provide a geometric interpretation of CBS, emphasizing symmetry, non-commutativity, and recurrence properties. Our approach maps multiple light scattering onto stochastic walks in group spaces, revealing that coherent backscattering emerges from symmetry-protected events. This conceptual shift offers a deeper structural insight into the CBS phenomenon, bridging mesoscopic wave transport with modern group-theoretic approaches.",
  "problem_framing": "We reframe Coherent Backscattering (CBS) from its classical interpretation as an interference effect between time-reversed paths to a more nuanced view as a stochastic dynamical phenomenon in non-abelian group spaces. This perspective highlights the role of symmetry and group structure, addressing the conceptual gap in understanding the deeper geometric origins of reciprocity and the significance of the backscattering direction.",
  "gap_pattern": "Current methods for interpreting Coherent Backscattering largely treat internal degrees of freedom as secondary factors. They fail to explain the robustness of reciprocal pairing in non-abelian groups like SO(3) or SU(2) as a channel for coherent return. By not accounting for the intrinsic group structure, existing theories overlook the symmetry-protected nature of these stochastic processes.",
  "solution": "Our methodology interprets multiple scattering events as stochastic walks on SO(3) or SU(2), where each scattering induces an incremental rotation. We derive a diffusion-like process to describe the accumulation of rotations, identifying coherent backscattering with doubled group walks returning near the identity element. This approach clarifies the geometric and stochastic roots of CBS, linking the enhanced probability density near the identity to the observable features of the CBS cone. By framing these processes within group dynamics, we align CBS with modern group-theoretic stochastic models, offering a unified and symmetry-rich interpretation.",
