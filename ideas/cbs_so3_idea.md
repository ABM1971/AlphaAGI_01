This idea proposes a theoretical and conceptual reformulation of Coherent Backscattering (CBS) in disordered optical media as a symmetry-constrained stochastic return process in a non-abelian group space, specifically the rotation group SO(3) or its double cover SU(2). The work is not based on machine-learning algorithms or data-driven modeling; instead, it develops an analytical and geometric interpretation grounded in group theory, stochastic processes, and mesoscopic wave physics.

Motivation and Context:
Coherent Backscattering is conventionally understood as an interference enhancement arising from pairs of time-reversed multiple-scattering paths in real space. While this framework successfully predicts the existence and basic features of the CBS cone, it largely treats internal degrees of freedom—such as accumulated rotations and polarization transformations—in a secondary or perturbative manner. As a result, the deeper geometric origin of reciprocity and the privileged role of the exact backscattering direction remain conceptually underexplored. The motivation of this work is to uncover a structural interpretation of CBS that makes symmetry, non-commutativity, and recurrence properties explicit.

Problem Definition:
The core problem addressed is the lack of a unified formalism that interprets CBS as a stochastic dynamical phenomenon in a space with intrinsic group structure. Standard CBS theory identifies interference between reciprocal paths as the mechanism behind the enhancement peak, but it does not explain why such reciprocal pairing leads to a robust return channel when internal rotations belong to a non-abelian group. In particular, it remains unclear how coherent return emerges generically despite the fact that random walks in SO(3) or SU(2) do not, in general, return to the identity element.

Proposed Theoretical Framework:
The proposed approach reinterprets multiple light scattering as a stochastic walk on the rotation group. Each scattering event induces an incremental rotation acting on the optical state, and a full multiple-scattering trajectory corresponds to a product of group elements. The reciprocal optical path is mapped onto the inverse group walk. Coherent Backscattering is then identified with doubled or paired group walks whose combined action returns close to the identity element. Such returns are non-generic in non-abelian groups and therefore represent symmetry-protected events rather than accidental geometric coincidences.

At an effective level, the accumulation of rotations is described by a diffusion-like process on SO(3)/SU(2). Within this description, doubled walks generate an enhanced probability density near the identity element of the group. This enhancement is directly related to the angular width and amplitude of the CBS cone, providing a geometric interpretation of the backscattering peak as a manifestation of constrained stochastic recurrence.

Relation to Equivariant Stochastic Processes:
This framework bears a formal and mathematical connection to equivariant diffusion processes studied in statistical physics and geometric modeling. In both cases, stochastic dynamics evolve in spaces endowed with group symmetry, and probability mass accumulates near symmetry-defined elements due to equivariance constraints. Importantly, this connection is conceptual rather than algorithmic: no learning-based diffusion models are employed. The relevance of this analogy lies in clarifying how symmetry governs recurrence and return probabilities in non-abelian spaces.

Technical Plan and Execution Scope:
The execution of the project is primarily analytical and theoretical. It consists of:
(i) establishing a rigorous mapping between multiple-scattering optical paths and stochastic walks in SO(3)/SU(2);
(ii) deriving an effective diffusion or Fokker-Planck-type description for the distribution of accumulated rotations;
(iii) demonstrating how doubled or reciprocal walks produce an enhanced probability density near the identity element; and
(iv) connecting this enhanced density to experimentally observable CBS features.
No large-scale numerical simulations or machine-learning pipelines are required.

Expected Contributions:
The expected contributions are conceptual and foundational. First, the work provides a unified geometric and stochastic interpretation of CBS rooted in non-abelian group dynamics. Second, it identifies doubled rotational walks as the fundamental mechanism enabling coherent return. Third, it offers a systematic language to analyze reciprocity breaking and coherence loss as symmetry-breaking processes in group space. Finally, it establishes a bridge between mesoscopic wave transport and modern group-theoretic approaches to stochastic dynamics, facilitating cross-disciplinary conceptual transfer.

Constraints and Scope:
The primary limitation of the approach is its abstract nature and the need to maintain clear connections between group-space constructs and experimentally measurable optical observables. The framework is intended to complement, rather than replace, standard CBS theory by providing a deeper structural and symmetry-based interpretation.

Several aspects of this framework remain intentionally open. These include the precise mathematical formulation of the diffusion process on the rotation group, the role of different group representations (SO(3) versus SU(2)), the extension to vector and tensor waves, and possible connections to localization, random lasing, or topological wave phenomena. These open directions define a structured but non-exhaustive hypothesis space to be explored.
